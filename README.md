<h1>OpenAL examples</h1>

"OpenAL examples" is a repository of examples code that uses OpenAL in several ways.
<ul>
 <li>You can find approaches to using other audio formats than WAVE files as input audio to OpenAL.</li>
 <li>You can find an explanation of OpenAL concepts like static vs streaming techniques for playing audio files.</li>
</ul>


The code has documentation (in Spanish) that remarks on the sources used to build the examples or from where I obtained them. The idea behind each use case and a little explanation of the code. Also, you can find a way to compile these examples from a Linux terminal. 

I tried to explicitly put the references from where I got the inspiration or the exact example that I reproduced, but if you miss one reference, please do not hesitate to send me an email.

Thanks to the community of persons that maintain the OpenAL website  <http://www.openal.org>, the "openal mailing list" <https://openal.org/mailman/listinfo/openal>  and especially to Chris by his OpenAL Soft <https://openal-soft.org/> that makes possible that everyone can use this standard.
